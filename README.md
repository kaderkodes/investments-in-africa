# Chinese Investments in Africa 

The purpose of this website is to graphically represent Chinese foreign direct investments in Africa, sorted per country. 

**Link to project:** https://investmentsinafrica.netlify.app/index.html


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This site is hosted via Netlify and coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The interactive map was created using SVG, the rough map was obtained from Wikimedia and then edited to fit the data.

Data about each country's net FDI inflows was obtained from the World Bank website.

Data about Chinaâ€™s FDI into each country was obtained via The Statistical Bulletin of China's Outward Foreign Direct Investment published by China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). 

The data was collected and presented in an excel file that was accessed via the China Africa Research Initiative (CARI) website. 

The charts were created using CanvasJS.

## Optimizations

Look into other data sets, and compare with the numbers provided by China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). 

Breakdown the funding into different categories to better visualized the allocation of the loans 


## Lessons Learned:

Adding the data necessary to create a graph for each country is a lengthy process that took multiple days, if I were to redo the project I would create a script to add the necessary information from the datasets.
